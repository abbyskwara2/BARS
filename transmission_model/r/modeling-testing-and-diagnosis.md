## Modeling Testing and Diagnosis

To model testing and diagnosis, we need some new constants and attributes. 

| Constants       | Attributes           | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Detection Window  (`detection.window`)    | Diagnosed (`diagnosed`)| 
| Mean time until next test (`mean.time.until.next.test`)      |  Time until next test (`time.until.next.test`)     |   
| Daily testing probability (`daily.testing.prob`) | Lag between diagnosis and ART initiaion  (`lag.bet.testing.and.art.init`) |      
|Lag between testing and ART initiation (`lag.bet.testing.and.art.init`) | |
