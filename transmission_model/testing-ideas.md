# Transmission Model Testing
  *The tests below can be run after some simulation time; for now, let's take it as 1825 time steps (5 years) 
  * After small fixes, model will have to be rerun. Those maxtimes can be decided based on the fix. 
  
## Calibration Output parameters   
   (this should perhaps be the last step)  
  * HIV Prevalence: At conclusion of burnin should be approximately equal to the empirically known prevalence  
  * HIV includence: At conclusion of burnin, annual incidence should be approximately equal to empirically known incidence.  
  Both prevalence and annual incidence over time should be plotted.
