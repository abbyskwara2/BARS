To create the network model.

1. Create the initial network model by sourcing the correct R file. Currently, that is,
"chicago-init-net-estimation-with-prep.R" which will create "initialized-model.RData"

2. Create the casual network by sourcing the correct file. Currently that is 
"chicago-init-cas-net-estimation.R". This will create "cas_net.RData".

3. Copy initialized-model.RData and cas_net.RData to ../network_model.
